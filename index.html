				<h1>My Self Introducation</h1>
				<p>
					Hello,
				</p>
				<p>
					It's my pleasure to share my page with you. I am Likai. Basically, I belong to Beijing. I have been living in Hamilton for 6 month now. I stay here with my family. Besides my parents, there is a younger sister in my family. Currently, I am exploring job opportunities in the automotive industry as I have recently finished Mechanical Engineering degree from University of Windsor.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am very interested in the automotive industry. That was the reason I chose to pursue higher studies in MEME in McMaster University. Post that, my internship experience and other practical projects in the undergraduate study further boosted my interest in auto companies as a full-time career option.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only am I passionate about the field I graduated in, I am also inclined towards creative activities such as dancing, painting, acting, etc. I have always been an active student in school and college. I have participated in many cultural events during my school and college days and have won many awards.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I enjoy going out with friends and trying new cuisines. I also enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading, working out, and going on road trips.
				</p>
